# Sypht Python Client

This repository is a Python 3+ reference client implementation for the Sypht API at https://api.sypht.com.

## About Sypht

[Sypht](https://sypht.com) is a SaaS [API](<(https://docs.sypht.com/)>) which extracts key fields from documents and images.

For example, you can upload an image or pdf of a bill or invoice and extract the amount due, due date, invoice number and biller information.

For an up-to-date list of supported extraction types, see the [Marketplace](https://app.sypht.com/marketplace).

## Getting started

To get started you'll need API credentials, i.e. a `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>`, which can be obtained by registering for an [account](https://www.sypht.com/)

## Installation

Latest version is available via pypi:

```
pip install sypht
```

## Usage

```python
from sypht.client import SyphtClient

sc = SyphtClient('<client_id>', '<client_secret>')

with open('invoice.png', 'rb') as f:
    fid = sc.upload(f, products=["forms-&-reports"])

print(sc.fetch_results(fid))
```

or run it via the command line:

```
export SYPHT_API_KEY="<client_id>:<client_secret>"
sypht extract --product invoices path/to/your/document.pdf
```
